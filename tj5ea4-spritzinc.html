                            <p> Reading from a screen is a complete different experience than reading from paper. We are doing some research about reading habits online, and UI/UX has a lot to do with it. What's next after PDFs, ePubs, blog articles, medium.com, kindle 
A few months ago I remember seeing this thing on reddit where the words would flash really quickly and you would read them that way so your eye wouldn't have to move and your WPM could increase. Does anyone know what I'm talking about. Hey guys, I have a question: I have already used Spreeder and Accellareader, but I remember seeing a similar product in developement awhile ago that actually re-centered the words onto the dominant syllable and colored those letters different from the rest of the word. I found this really useful since I'm dyslexic, but I can't remember what it's called or where I found it. Any help would be great (not sure if it's done it may still just be in beta). Thanks. I'm not a huge fan of reading texts on the computer, but being in grad school, it is quicker and usually cheaper than buying a physical text book. However, in order to read a text book or academic articles on the computer, I have to use a sheet of paper to read one line at a time (moving the paper down to each new line as I go along). Is there any feature / addon or whatever for the Kindle that can black out all the text except for the line I am pointing at with my mouse or with the arrow. Since old phone screens are so small it would be fun to make a small marque that uses an old phone, to display updates and calendar info, for our local makerspace. ive downloaded over a dozen scrolling marque things and they all are not designed for remote controlling/updating. Bonus if it gives up on the scrolling idea, and uses Spritz aka Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP), style flash cards. like this. (http://spritzinc.com/#). I'm a skeptic. Spritz seemed too-good-to-be-true. So I wanted to find out myself. So I made this simple chrome extension that basically does Spritz: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/readline/hjbkmfadmomgaokjodomncmbgmmodona Those who don't know Spritz: I want to use it in for a couple days. I want to see if my productivity really increases. I want to see if my eye movement was really taking 80% of my reading time. More importantly, I want to get more people. If you don't know, Spritz ( is developing speed reading software. It's pretty cool. I, like many others, was curious about it. I've made my own version that you can use. Check out my tool. ( The link on that page is a bit of JS. Drag it into your bookmarks. Surf the web, load the JS on any web page. Select the text, and press 'R'. Let me know what you guys think! Github (https://github.com/mikeprescott/EasyReadBox). So there is a new lore, I feel very invested in the game currently. However with a busy life I don't have time to take my time. SO I use these Spritz ( and this ( It might work out for you. It might not. But's it's how I'm going to keep up with you guys (#seemsgood). 
There's a book I need to read and I know there are a lot of platforms like Spritz ( that show the reader one word at a time. They flash the words super fast and your eyes don't have to move so it enhances reading speed. I have a epub file on my PC that I want to read in that fashion but I can't find a way to do. I have an E-reader application that allows me to read it book-style and the website Spritz only has mobile apps. Anyone know of a platform I could accomplish. Hi guys, The past year i discovered Spritz ( a company who developed a new way to read, faster and easier than any other fast reading method, it's great, but not open, so i decided to make my own, but for reading The Book of Mormon with some customization in order to meet my needs. Here's the result ( i hope you like it and give some feedback. I discovered this service/app that let's you read a text without moving your eyes. All the words appear in a sequence on a single spot. On this site you can try it and adjust the reading speed you want: My impression is that this could be used for reading emails/books on for example a smaller device, like a smartwatch. But is it actually better than reading a book on actual paper or full screen? Doesn't the reading comprehension make it suitable only for non-technical. When talking to NPCs, I noticed I stopped reading them because it felt like a bit of a slog to have to step back and focus on each word to read it. Doesn't feel as effortless as in a 2d game. Could it benefit from a Spritz ( implementation? Here's a gif of someone implementing it in a game. (https://gfycat.com/firsthandwellworndotterel) In the gif above, it has a way of feeling like the spider is talking even though there's no audible voice. There could be pause. I've always noticed that when I am reading something (with someone else) I tend to scroll or flip pages too quickly. I found Spritz ( about a year ago and I have not heard it it mentioned here yet. It's pretty great for reading long articles without a ton of deep info. I use it at ~700WPM for "light" reading and ~450 for technical reading, pausing (to contemplate) when necessary. No, I'm not talking about braille or anthing like that. There is an app that allows you to read text really fast by showing things 1 word at a time. I don't know about you, but the reason I don't read books is because my mind always goes on auto pilot and I have to reread the same page 3-4 times before being able to move on. I found this to have some potential. http://www.spritzinc.com/#. I'm personally referring to the Spritz bookmarklet, which actually works fine when you test it on their test-page on mobile ( Thanks. 
I love to read but often struggle to keep interested. Today I came accross Spritz, an API that is supposed to help read faster and better. By faster, I mean I could read a full text at 600word per minute, was able to focus the whole time I read it and still understood the text. I forwarded the link to a few friends of mine with problem to read, either they are ADHD or are Dislexyc (I forgot how to write that word) and they all thought it was great. In case you want to test, it's here:. It would be awesome if there was a plugin that would be able to display txt files on a rockbox device using RSVP techniques such as those found on I know there is a text reader which I used on a Clip Zip and it seems like it would be possible to make something like this happen. Because I do want to read them, but I also really don't. this is that spritz thing if you don't know what I'm talking about http://spritzinc.com/. I would pay decent money for an AW compatible reading app that has Spritz Inc. technology ( My favorite Spritz-like app for Android right now is Balto Speed Reading. Struggling with dyslexia my whole life I found ways with my parent's help to work through the gift. As a graduate student in Geology I have to read long and difficult papers constantly, I found a tool that helps me read better and retain knowledge better. Anyway, check it out. http://www.spritzinc.com/. 
What is the best way to learn? What is the best way to ingest new information? is there something amazing not being implemented in day to day teaching? Thinking about stuff like: Classroom augmentation / refinement, Audio books, stuff like http://www.spritzinc.com/. I love using different plugins, sites, apps etc. to help stay productive! Can we compile a nice list with descriptions? Currently I use Beeline Reader ( pretty often. And I just discovered Spritz ( which seems pretty interesting. I'd love if we could gather some more of these neat tools has an IOS SDK, it would be awesome to be able to read longer text posts by tapping a button using something like this on the small iphone screen.
